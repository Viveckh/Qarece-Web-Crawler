<br>- 90 x vegetarian capsules Skinny Bird™ Supplement
<br><br><b>Clinical Results: </b> Flatter Me: 
<br>Hum Nutrition's research has identified the strong correlation between weight and indigestion. The formulation for Flatter Me is based on findings regarding food and drink choices, as well as key wellness habits including smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, and the use of nutritional supplements. Of the 6226 women surveyed:
<br>- 64% reported unbalanced digestion
<br>- 79% expressed the desire to lose weight
<br>- 72% already take dietary supplements. HUM’s researchers took this data, combined it with food and lifestyle choices and handpicked clinically-proven and plant based micro nutrients to help solve digestive issues through Flatter Me.
<br><br>Skinny Bird:
<br>Taking 5-HTP as a supplement increases the production of serotonin. Serotonin in the hypothalamus is thought to be involved in regulating food intake, promoting within-meal satiation, and improving post-meal satiety. Preliminary evidence suggest that taking 5-HTP orally, 300 mg three times daily 30 minutes before meals for 2 to 12 weeks improves early satiety and decreases daily caloric intake in obese women.
<br><br>In a randomized, double blind placebo controlled clinical trial:
<br>- C.fimbriata extract and placebo were orally administered as 500 mg capsules twice daily (1 g/day) and dietary intake and exercise were monitored weekly

Skin looks firmer and plumper as the appearance of youthful bounce and an even tone are restored. The gold standard form of vitamin C, THD ascorbate is both highly stable and oil-soluble, helping it to rapidly absorb into the skin for enhanced tone, clarity, and visible brightening. This hydrating antioxidant formula instantly polishes, protects, and illuminates the skin, while phytosterols help to reduce the look of redness and skin sensitivity. Saccharide isomerate extract diminishes the appearance of pores and reinforces the skin’s moisture barrier for a skin-smoothing glow. Luna works throughout the night to deliver more visibly youthful, luminous, even-toned skin in the morning. Trans-retinoic acid ester (retinol) complex reduces the appearance of pores and wrinkles, while visibly improving the signs of premature aging, including fine lines, uneven texture, age spots, dryness, and dullness. Balanced with blue tansy and German chamomile essential oils&#151;both rich in soothing, blue azulene&#151;the look of surface redness is visibly balanced for a calm, even-toned complexion. Luna is clinically proven to improve the appearance of fine lines, radiance, and skin smoothness in as little as four weeks, while advanced retinol ester mixed with potent botanicals makes this product the ultimate transformational, soothing, sleeping night oil.<br><br><b>This set contains:</b><br>- 0.27 oz/8 mL C.E.O Rapid Flash Brightening Serum<br>- 0.17 oz/5 mL Luna Sleeping Night Oil<br><br><b>What it is formulated WITHOUT:</b><br>- Parabens<br>- Sulfates<br>- Phthalates<br><br><b>What else you need to know:</b><br> This product is gluten- and cruelty-free.<br><br><b>Research results:</b><br> In an in-vivo test(silicone replicas) using expert visual grading Luna Sleeping Night Oil is clinically proven to improve skin radiance, fine lines, and smoothness in 4 weeks. <br><br>-After an independent consumer testing panel used Luna Sleeping Night Oil for 4 weeks: <br>- 100% felt the product absorbed well into the skin <br>- 96% of women felt their skin looked brighter and more radiant <br>- 96% of women felt their skin looked healthier and revitalized <br>- 92% of women felt their skin tone looked more even, calmer, smoother <br>- 92% would recommend Luna to a family member or friend <br>- 88% felt their pores looked smaller <br>- 85% felt their fine lines and wrinkles around the forehead were visibly improved",8.4,7.5,5000,43.9,1,Multivitamins Set,28.0,,"https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2073641-main-zoom.jpg,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/product/p432053-av-01-zoom.jpg,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/product/p432053-av-02-zoom.jpg",,https://www.sephora.com/product/multivitamins-set-P432053?skuId=2073641,0.3,A go-to day and night regimen combining the power of vitamin C and retinol to brighten and visibly transform your complexion.,sephora-2073641,Sephora,,taxable,1.5,0,simple,1,visible

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,ELLIS BROOKLYN,Women>Fragrances & Perfumes>Gift Sets,"Choose your own fragrance Adventure with this playful and innovative new set. Three Ellis Brooklyn best-selling eau de parfums (Myth, Rrose, and Sci Fi) meet three single notes (Mandarin, Patchouli, and Tuberose) for endless, goof-proof scent combinations. The single notes are of fine perfume quality and feature all natural ingredients that are the heart of every perfumer's lab. This set makes it easy to personalize your own signature scent&#151;because life is more fun if you play fragrance games.  
<br>
<br>Myth is the most alluring musk. Built around Bergamot, cassis and jasmine petals, it makes a first impression before lingering with patchouli, liquid musks, and white cedarwood.  
<br>
<br>Rrose is not your grandma's rose. A sparkling combination of Centifolia rose petals and Sicilian lemon hover over vanilla orchid and spring musks. 
<br>
<br>Sci Fi is an otherworldly vanilla&#151;an intriguing, unforgettable blend of green tea, pink freesia, bitter orange and vanilla beans. 
<br>
<br><b>This set contains:</b>
<br>- 6 x 0.07 oz/ 2 mL Travel Sprays in Rrose, Myth, Sci-Fi, Tuberose, Mandarin, Patchouli 
<br>
<br><b>What else you need to know:</b>
<br>&quot;Sure I've read and written about fragrance layering, but truth be told, layering two complex scents together can be easy to mess up. That's why I came up with this set where you can easily control adding a single note here or there.  It's also how I play and interact with my perfumers when we're in the lab. You can dial up and control a single ingredient which is more approachable and also more fun.&quot;&#151;Bee Shapiro, founder of Ellis Brooklyn     
<br>
<br>Must-try combinations:
<br>Rrose + Tuberose: Add gorgeous complexity to our sparkling Rrose with the addition of enchanting creamy Tuberose. 
<br>Sci Fi + Patchouli: Sci Fi's clean vanilla notes turn sultry when paired with the grounded earthiness of perfume-quality Patchouli. 
<br>Myth and Mandarin: Love the idea of a warm yet fresh scent? Myth takes on a heightened zesty spin when matched with Mandarin. 
<br>
<br>All Ellis Brooklyn eau de parfums are paraben-free, phthalates-free, vegan, and cruelty-free.
