<br><br><b>What it is:</b><br>A black travel-size pillow and matching sleep mask, each made with high-quality mulberry silk to protect the skin and hair from aging and provide you with the ultimate beauty sleep. 
<br><br><b>Key benefits:</b><br>- Fine lines and wrinkles
<br><br><b>If you want to know more…</b><br>We spend a third of our lives in bed. Silk fibers are significantly less absorbent than many other fibers, so they can help keep your skin’s moisture and expensive face and hair products where they belong&#151;on your face and hair. 
<br><br>As skin ages, it loses elasticity and sleep creases can become more pronounced and longer-lasting. While the creases usually go away later that day, they can be gradually ‘ironed in’ over the years. Slipsilk&trade; reduces friction, which can reduce stretching and tugging on delicate facial skin, and instead allows skin to glide along the pillow while reducing extra pressure on creased skin.
<br><br>Spare your hair! Ordinary pillowcases can cause hair to pull and tangle throughout the night, leading to bed head in the morning and potentially damaging hair, whereas Slipsilk can help to reduce roughness. The world’s most renowned stylists and beauty experts have long recommended sleeping on gentle, hair-friendly silk to help preserve your blowout. 

<br><br><b>This set contains:</b><br>- Travel Size Pillow with Black Slipsilk&trade; Pillowcase
<br>- Black Slipsilk&trade; Sleep Mask
<br><br><b>What else you need to know:</b><br> The Slipsilk difference: Slipsilk is specially-commissioned and made to Slip Beauty’s exacting standards, developed and re­fined over 10 years to provide the ultimate combination of shine, thickness, softness, and durability. They use the highest grade (6A) long­fiber mulberry silk, with a thickness of 22 momme and enforce the strictest quality guidelines, including non-toxic dyes.

<br>&quot;We love Italy and all its beauty. We often escape to Positano, a small village perched on the Amalfi coast. Seen from a distance, Positano appears to be a dramatic vertical panorama of colors; the green of the Monti Lattari, the white, pink, and yellow of the traditional Mediterranean architecture, the silvery grey of its pebble beaches and the deep blue of the sea and the sky. Orange Positano reveals the joyful, lively perfume of this magical escape.&quot;&#151;Sylvie Ganter and Christophe Cervasel, Brand Founders

<br>
<br> Atelier Cologne Candles are created with the highest percentage of fragrances oils combined with a custom blend of the best waxes.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,ELLIS BROOKLYN,Women>Fragrances & Perfumes>Gift Sets,"Choose your own fragrance Adventure with this playful and innovative new set. Three Ellis Brooklyn best-selling eau de parfums (Myth, Rrose, and Sci Fi) meet three single notes (Mandarin, Patchouli, and Tuberose) for endless, goof-proof scent combinations. The single notes are of fine perfume quality and feature all natural ingredients that are the heart of every perfumer's lab. This set makes it easy to personalize your own signature scent&#151;because life is more fun if you play fragrance games.  
<br>
<br>Myth is the most alluring musk. Built around Bergamot, cassis and jasmine petals, it makes a first impression before lingering with patchouli, liquid musks, and white cedarwood.  
<br>
<br>Rrose is not your grandma's rose. A sparkling combination of Centifolia rose petals and Sicilian lemon hover over vanilla orchid and spring musks. 
<br>
<br>Sci Fi is an otherworldly vanilla&#151;an intriguing, unforgettable blend of green tea, pink freesia, bitter orange and vanilla beans. 
<br>
<br><b>This set contains:</b>
<br>- 6 x 0.07 oz/ 2 mL Travel Sprays in Rrose, Myth, Sci-Fi, Tuberose, Mandarin, Patchouli 
<br>
<br><b>What else you need to know:</b>
<br>&quot;Sure I've read and written about fragrance layering, but truth be told, layering two complex scents together can be easy to mess up. That's why I came up with this set where you can easily control adding a single note here or there.  It's also how I play and interact with my perfumers when we're in the lab. You can dial up and control a single ingredient which is more approachable and also more fun.&quot;&#151;Bee Shapiro, founder of Ellis Brooklyn     
<br>
<br>Must-try combinations:
<br>Rrose + Tuberose: Add gorgeous complexity to our sparkling Rrose with the addition of enchanting creamy Tuberose. 
<br>Sci Fi + Patchouli: Sci Fi's clean vanilla notes turn sultry when paired with the grounded earthiness of perfume-quality Patchouli. 
<br>Myth and Mandarin: Love the idea of a warm yet fresh scent? Myth takes on a heightened zesty spin when matched with Mandarin. 
<br>
<br>All Ellis Brooklyn eau de parfums are paraben-free, phthalates-free, vegan, and cruelty-free.

The pore-refining triple charcoal complex contains three charcoals to detox skin, while botanical ingredients like TEAOXI&reg; eucalyptus leaf, licorice root, and cumin seed purify. Skin-refining, powerful AHAs support natural cell turnover and renewal, while K17 and Mediterranean clays absorb oils to mattify skin and restore balance to your complexion. Skin is visibly improved after each cleanse, with a diminished appearance of pores and a refined texture and tone.
