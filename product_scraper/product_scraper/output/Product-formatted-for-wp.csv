<br><b>What else you need to know:</b>
<br>Internationally renowned makeup artist Natasha Denona developed her own eyeshadow formulas after struggling for over 20 years with eyeshadows that were dry, dull, and difficult to blend.

<br>
<br>&quot;When I launched these palettes everyone told me I was crazy because there are so many shades inside. I made them like this because I had to create a kit with all the basic colors that came in cool tones and warm tones from light to dark and in several textures. My 28 Palettes have become world renowned and the favorites of Desi Perkins, Nikki Tutorials, Wayne Goss, Kathleen Lights, and Jaclyn Hill. The formula is out of this world! It was a dream for me to create a pressed pigment that was easy for everyone to use. You can create endless looks with the 28 Palette. It’s a revolutionary product and a must have for everyone.&quot;&#151;Natasha Denona

<br><br>This product is cruelty-free.

<br>Internationally renowned makeup artist Natasha Denona developed her own eyeshadow formulas after struggling for over 20 years with eyeshadows that were dry, dull, and difficult to blend. Natasha’s easy-to-use pressed pigments have been chosen as the best in the world by the most influential beauty gurus and leading makeup artists.
<br><br>
Natasha Denona’s Eyeshadow palettes have changed the makeup game around the globe.  Each unique palette supports anti-aging and offers extraordinarily rich, pure pigments, ultra-high color payoff, and buttery, creamy, easy-to-blend formulas. They’re also long-lasting, water-resistant, are formulated with a high percentage of mica to hydrate, and they’re infused with real crushed pearls. Natasha's revolutionary formula is ultra-pigmented, blends like a dream, and is long lasting.

<br>
<br>&quot;The 5 Eyeshadow Palettes are based on a concept of personal matching which is a system I have been teaching over 15 years. Each 5 palette can be used to create multiple stunning looks with whatever combination of shadows you chose. The 5 Palette is a great intro to my eyeshadows.&quot;&#151;Natasha Denona

<br> The aqua-activated sponge grows to about twice its size and absorbs minimal product so your favorite formula lands on your complexion, not your sponge. When wet, the super soft material provides an even, smooth blend, and bounce. The large rounded surface area ensures a quick application while the contoured tip offers precision. <br><br>
beautyblender has chosen to use non-toxic, water-soluble dyes. For this reason, your beautyblender may shed dye for the first couple of washes&#151;similar to a pair of blue jeans. Once you squeeze the water out of the beautyblender, the excess dye is removed as well. The dye does not transfer to the skin.<br><br>

<br>A highlighter palette with two different textures: a pearlescent creamy shade and three light-catching pressed pearl hues.
<br>
<br><b>What it does:</b>
<br> Inspired by Huda Kattan’s hack of layering oil with powder highlighter to amplify her glow, this palette is packed with two different textures. The Melted Strobe, a pearlescent creamy formula enriched with karite butter, creates a flawless, lit-from-within canvas for layering powders. The three, light-catching pressed pearls are staggered in complimentary tones to give you sculpted, 3D radiance. With effortless blendability and layering power, this palette lets you build and sculpt your highlight to a desired level of radiance&#151;from subtle, natural radiance to an all-over glow.
<br>

<br>- 0.35 oz/ 10.3 mL Melted Strobe Cream Highlight

<br>
<br><b>What else you need to know:</b>
<br> &quot;I wanted to make getting the ultimate glow easy for everyone. So we combined colors, formula and technique to make highlighting like a pro within each person’s grasp. Highlighter can really magnify any makeup, but there are concerns for people with larger pores as the pigments tend to emphasize skin unevenness which is a problem that I have. I love to blend face oils and pigments together to smooth the skin texture and amplify the reflection of the pearls. That’s when I knew I had to create this highlighter. It’s the all-in-one, ultimate cheek palette for everyone.&quot;&#151;Huda Kattan

<br>beautyblender has chosen to use non-toxic, water-soluble dyes. For this reason, your beautyblender may shed dye for the first couple of washes&#151;similar to a pair of blue jeans. Once you squeeze the water out of the beautyblender, the excess dye is removed as well. The dye does not transfer to the skin.
